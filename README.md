# ProgressTracker 

## Introduction

I found that people nowadays either have few real hobbies or have too many interests for which they don't have the 
time. But for me, a lot of time is wasted every day by being distracted by social media and other mundanities of 
everyday life, time that could be used to better oneself.

The *ProgressTracker* can help in pursuing new interests, improving in their hobbies, or honing their skills. With a
log of weekly updates, and setting short-term and long-term goals for each subject, the *ProgressTracker* provides
organization and planning that allows for us to track how we are doing and improve efficiently and consistently.

- add an update to a list of updates for each subject, with a description of progress and the goal for the next 
update
